"""
env_mp.py — Multiplayer Balatro environment for V8 self-play training.

Wraps two V7-style agents playing against each other via MultiplayerBalatro.
Each player gets the standard V7 observation (434 dims) and hierarchical action
space (intent + card subset for SELECTING_HAND, phase actions for blind/shop).

The multiplayer coordinator handles:
  - Same-seed card draws for both players
  - Lives system (4 per player)
  - HOUSE RULE: regular blind failures cost a life
  - PvP blind resolution (higher score wins, loser loses life + comeback money)
  - Game termination on 0 lives

Reward structure per player:
  - All V7 rewards (card quality, synergy, blind clear, etc.)
  - NEW: PvP win: +3.0 | PvP loss: -2.0 | PvP tie: 0
  - NEW: Game win (opponent hit 0 lives): +20.0 | Game loss: -10.0

  # Both players act simultaneously each step
