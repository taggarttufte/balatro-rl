"""
mp_game.py — Multiplayer Balatro game coordinator.

Wraps two BalatroGame instances with shared seed for deterministic card draws
and independent shops. Implements Attrition mode with our house rule change:
**failing a regular blind ALSO costs a life** (vs the official mod which only
loses lives on PvP).

Game flow per ante:
  1. Both players play Small Blind on same seed (same cards drawn)
     - Player failing loses a life (HOUSE RULE, not official mod)
  2. Both players play Big Blind on same seed (same cards drawn)
     - Same life penalty on failure
  3. PvP Blind — both players play, higher score wins
     - Loser loses a life (official mod rule)
     - Winner gets no bonus life
     - Both players get comeback money ($4 per life lost this round)

Game ends when either player reaches 0 lives. Survivor wins.
If both hit 0 on same round, the one with more antes cleared wins.
If tied, it's a draw.

Notes:
- Both players get IDENTICAL decks (same seed) and see SAME cards each blind
- Shops are INDEPENDENT (different random offerings per player)
- Boss blind effect applies to BOTH players on PvP blind (same restrictions)
